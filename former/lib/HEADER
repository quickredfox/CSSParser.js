  CSSParser.js v0.1
 
  A CSS parser written in javascript.

  CSSParser is a re-write of the MIT Licensed jquery-css-parser 
  found here http://bililite.com/blog/2009/01/16/jquery-css-parser
  Which is copyrighted 2009 Daniel Wachsstock. MIT Licensed.
 
  The idea was to separate the parser from jquery and my concerns
  being different than the original author's intent, I simply 
  decided it would be more convenient to just copy/paste and 
  mix it up a little. Also, I was not satisfied /w the original API.
  
 
  Usage:
 
   The code below is all you need to write your own processor:
   
   CSSParser.addProcessor('myprocessor',
       function(css) {
           var parsed = {};
           for(var selector in css){
               var properties = css[selector];
               for(var property in properties){
                   var value = properties[property];
                   // do something with value for example
                   if(/px/.test(value)) parsed[selector][property] = value.replace(/px/g,'em');
               }
           }
           return parsed;
       }
   );
